# Spotify Statistics

Displays statistics for an authenticated user using [spotify's web api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
and [redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).

The app uses the [Implicit Grant Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#implicit-grant-flow)
authorization flow provided by the api.
